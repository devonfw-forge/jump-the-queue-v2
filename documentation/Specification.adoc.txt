== Introduction ==

When visiting public (free) or private (paid) events there are often large queues creating significant waiting times. Ideally the organizer 
of the event would like to streamline the entry of people. That would be possible by allowing people privileged access or, alternatively, 
offer an incentive for people to arrive in time or to get into line more efficiently. A way of doing this would be to have a website or 
application which would allow visitors to "Jump the Queue". 

Ideally the users of the queue have to be able to know at which time could be their turn. It is really important because they can improve their time and they will only need to be in the queue on the right time.

Furthermore, to facilitate that the user does not have to be in the queue waiting its turn, he can consult the queue status at any device that he may have. (for example a mobile phone, tablet,  ..)

This document describes the design for such an application: “JumpTheQueue”.


=== The JumpTheQueue application ===
The JumpTheQueue application allows users to:

- Eliminate the need of waiting in a queue.
- Improve user experience, easing the access to the queue.
- Manage queues.

== Use Cases ==


=== Actors ===

[width="100%",options="", cols="v,a"]
|====================
| ACR_User a|
- It is an internal user of the external system that creates the queue and it will have privilege access to the queue.
| ACR_Visitor |
- User of the queue component that does not exist in the external system that created the queue.
| ACR_Owner |
- User that manages the queue.

= Components
image::images/devon4j/4.Components/architecture.png[Architecture, 700]

When working with _devon4j_ the recommended approach for designing an applications is _Component Oriented Design_. Each component will represent a significant part (or feature) of our application related to _CRUD_ operations. Internally, the components will be divided into three layers (_service_, _logic_, and _dataaccess_) and will communicate in two directions: service with database or -- in the _logic_ layer -- a component with another component.

== Principles
The benefits of dividing our application into components are:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns[separation of concerns]

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability[reusability]

- to avoid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_code[redundant code]

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding[information hiding]

- self contained, descriptive and stable component https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface[APIs]

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_consistency[data consistency] (a component is responsible for its data and changes to this data shall only happen via the component)

=== Component Structure
A component consists of three packages, which correspond to the three layers defined by the _devon4j_ architecture: _service_, _logic_ and _dataaccess_.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/layers.png[Component Layers, 300]

* _Service_ layer: exposes the REST API to exchange information with client applications

* _Logic_ layer: in charge of hosting the business logic of the application

* _Data Access_ layer: communicates with the database

Apart from that, most components will have a fourth package -- _common_ -- to store shared elements, which will be used by all layers of the component. It will contain common _interfaces_, _constants_, _exceptions_ or _enumerations_.

=== Component Core
As we mentioned earlier, each component will be related to a functionality. This functionality will be represented in code by an _Entity_ that defines all the properties needed to wrap the logic of that feature.

This _Entity_ represents the "core" of the component and will be located in the `dataaccess.api` package.

The naming convention for these entities in _devon4j_ is:
----
[Target]Entity
----

"Target" should match the name of the related table in the database -- although this is not mandatory.

Basically, each _Entity_ is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object[POJO] (plain old Java object) that will be mapped to a table in the database and represent each column via a suitable property.

.An entity and its corresponding table in the DB (taken from another application).
[caption="Example: "]
image::images/devon4j/4.Components/example_entity.png[Example Entity, 800]

== Create your Components
We are now going to create our first app components. Our example application needs to provide two basic functionalities:

* register a user (returning an access code)
* show registered queue members

To accomplish this we are going to work with three entities; _Visitor_, _Queue_ and _AccessCode_:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/jtq_entities.png[JumpTheQueue Entities, 750]

The components will be defined as follows:

[caption=""]
|===
|Owner| Access Code | Queue

|username
|ticketNumber
|name

|name
|creationTime
|logo

|password
|startTime
|password

|phoneNumber
|endTime
|currentNumber

|acceptedCommercial
|--
|attentionTime

|acceptedTerms
|--
|minAttentionTime

|userType
|--
|active

|--
|--
|customers
|===

In addition, we will have to represent two relationships:

  1. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_(data_model)[one to one] relation between _Visitor_ and _Access Code_.

  2. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)[one to many] relation between _Daily Queue_ and _Access Code_.

Now is the moment to decide about the components of our app. The low complexity of the functionality would allow us to create only one component for managing all entities. In order to clarify the example we are going to create three managing components however; one for _Visitor_, one for _Access Code_ and one for _Daily Queue_.

[NOTE]
====
If you feel more comfortable managing all the entities in a single component, you could also do it this way. The result will be the same, the only difference will be the structure of some elements and the distribution of code inside the packages.
====

=== The Database
Projects created with the _devon4j_ archetype already contain a pre-defined database schema, which we can use as a basis to create our own. We are going to utilize the http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2 Database Engine], because our generated _devon4j_ application uses it by default.

There is already one predefined schema:
----
jtqj-core/src/main/resources/db/migration/1.0/V0001__Create_Sequence.sql
----

As we want to use the h2 database, we are going to create an `h2` folder by right-clicking the folder `/jtqj-core/src/main/resources/db` and selecting `New > Folder`. We are simly going to call this folder `h2`.
Now we have to add the path to the `h2-folder` in the file `applications.properites`.
Navigate to `/jtqj-core/source/main/resources/db/applications.properties` and add ', classpath:db/h2' as follows

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/application_properties.png[Application Properties, 500]

We are now able to create our tables in `h2`. 

==== _Owner_ Table
We are going to create our own table for _Owner(s)_ by right-clicking the new folder `/jtqj-core/src/main/resources/db/h2` and selecting `New > File`. Following the naming scheme we are going to call it:
----
V0002__Create_Owner.sql
----

An owner will provide: _username_ and a _password_ in order to obtain an _AccessCode_:
[source, sql]
----
create table Owner(
  id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  modificationCounter INTEGER NOT NULL,
  username VARCHAR(255),
  password VARCHAR(255),
  userType BOOL DEFAULT '0',
  CONSTRAINT PK_Owner PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
----

* _id_: The ID of each owner.
* _modificationCounter_: Used internally by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[JPA] to take care of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control[optimistic locking] for us.
* _username_: The ownders email adress.
* _password_: The ownders password.
* _userType_: Denotes the type of user.

==== _Queue_ Table
In a second table we will represent the _Daily Queue_, which will contain _createdDate_, _minAttentionTime_, _started_. This table will be created in `/jtqj-core/src/main/resources/db/type/h2`, and is called:
----
V0003__Create_Queue.sql
----

It will contain the following declarations:
[source, sql]
----
create table Queue(
  id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  createdDate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  modificationCounter INTEGER NOT NULL,
  minAttentionTime INTEGER NOT NULL,
  started BOOL DEFAULT '0',
  CONSTRAINT PK_Queue PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
----

* _id_: The ID of each queue.
* _modificationCounter_: Used internally by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[JPA] to take care of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control[optimistic locking] for us.
* _createdDate_: Date when the queue was created.
* _minAttentionTime_: Minimum time required to attend a visitor, set by default.
* _started_: Denotes wether the queue has satarted

==== _Access Code_ Table
The third table will represent the _Access Code_ and contain the _ticketNumber_, _creationTime_, _startTime_ and _endTime_. This table will be created in `/jtqj-core/src/main/resources/db/type/h2`, and is called:
----
V0004__Create_Access_Code.sql
----

It will contain the following declarations:
[source, sql]
----
create table AccessCode(
  id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  createdDate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  modificationCounter INTEGER NOT NULL,
  code VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
  uuid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  startTime TIMESTAMP,
  endTime TIMESTAMP,
  status INTEGER NOT NULL,
  idQueue BIGINT NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_AccessCode PRIMARY KEY(id),
  CONSTRAINT FK_AccessCode_idQueue FOREIGN KEY(idQueue) REFERENCES Queue(id)
);
----

* _id_: The ID of each code.
* _modificationCounter_: Used internally by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[JPA] to take care of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control[optimistic locking] for us.
* _code_: The number of the ticket for a queue.
* _uuid_: #TODO
* _createdDate_: The date and time of creation.
* _startTime_: The date and time, from which the code is valid.
* _endTime_: The date and time, when the code expires.
* _status_: The status of the owner in relation to a queue with respect to the aspects WAITING, ATTENDING, ATTENDED, SKIPPED, NOTSTARTED
* _idQueue_: The relation with the _DailyQueue_ table.

==== Mock Data
Finally we are going to provide a certain amount of mock data, which will be available right from the start in our application. Create a new SQL script in `/jtqj-core/src/main/resources/db/migration/1.0/`, called:
----
V0005__Master_data.sql
----

Copy and paste the following data into it:
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO Owner(id, modificationCounter, username, password, userType) VALUES (0, 1, 'adcenter', 'adcenter', '1');
----

=== The Core of the Components
Now that we have defined the database for our entities, we should start creating the code of the related components.

We are going to use CobiGen to generate the component structure. That means that -- as already commented -- we can generate all the structure and layers starting from a _core_ element: a simple _Plain Old Java Object_ that represents our _Entity_. So, in order to use CobiGen, we have to create our entities in the expected locations (as you will see in the following section): `<entitymanagement>.dataaccess.api`.

==== _Owner_ Component
To implement the component we will need to define an _OwnerEntity_ to connect and manage the data of the _Owner_ table in the database. The name of this component will be `ownermanagement`, the entity will be called `OwnerEntity`.

Right-click on the root folder of the project `/jtqj-core/src/main/java`, select `New > Package` and create the following package:
----
com.devonfw.application.jtqj.ownermanagement.dataaccess.api
----

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/new_package_1.png[New Package Creation Step 1, 500]
image::images/devon4j/4.Components/new_package_2.png[New Package Creation Step 2, 500]

Now create a new Java class in this package and call it `OwnerEntity`:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/class_generation.png[Class Generation, 500]
image::images/devon4j/4.Components/new_class.png[New Class Creation, 500]

We are going to need fields, which represent the data model, so our entity should contain the following code:

[source,java]
----
  ...
 
  private String username;

  private String password;

  private Boolean userType;

  ...
----

[NOTE]
====
We are not adding _id_ or _modificationCounter_, because CobiGen will generate these fields for us.
====

Now we need to declare our entity as a JPA entity with the `@Entity` annotation (_javax.persistence.Entity_) at class level. To map the entity to the database table, we will use the `@Table` annotation (_javax.persistence.Table_) defining the `name` of our already created _Owner_ table (also at class level):
[source, java]
----
...

@Entity
@Table(name = "Owner")
public class OwnerEntity {
  
  ...
----
 
Now we have to declare the _getter_ and _setter_ methods for the fields of our entity. We can do this manually or automatially generate them using Eclipse:
L
image::images/devon4j/4.Components/getter_setter.png[Generating Getter and Setter Methods with Eclipse]

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/select_getter_setter.png.png[Select Getter Setter, 500]

Now click on `Select All` and `Generate` in order to generate gatters and setters for each variable.
The resulting implementation of our _OwnerEntity_ class should now look like this:

[source,java]
----
package com.devonfw.application.jtqj.ownermanagement.dataaccess.api;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Table;

@Entity
@Table(name = "Owner")
public class OwnerEntity {

  private String username;

  private String password;

  private Boolean userType;

  /**
   * @return username
   */
  public String getUsername() {
  
    return this.username;
  }

  /**
   * @param username new value of {@link #getusername}.
   */
  public void setUsername(String username) {
  
    this.username = username;
  }

  /**
   * @return password
   */
  public String getPassword() {
  
    return this.password;
  }

  /**
   * @param password new value of {@link #getpassword}.
   */
  public void setPassword(String password) {
  
    this.password = password;
  }

  /**
   * @return userType
   */
  public Boolean getUserType() {
  
    return this.userType;
  }

  /**
   * @param userType new value of {@link #getuserType}.
   */
  public void setUserType(Boolean userType) {
  
    this.userType = userType;
  }
}
----

==== _AccessCode_ component
We are going to repeat the same process for the _AccessCode_ component. Create these packages in `/jtqj-core/src/main/java`:
----
com.devonfw.application.jtqj.accesscodemanagement.dataaccess.api
----

\... and create a class called `AccessCodeEntity` inside of them. +
We will end up with the following structure:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/accesscode_entity.png[AccessCode Entity, 250]

The contents of _AccessCodeEntity_ before using CobiGen will be:

[source,java]
----
package com.devonfw.application.jtqj.accesscodemanagement.dataaccess.api;

import java.sql.Timestamp;

import javax.persistence.CascadeType;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.FetchType;
import javax.persistence.JoinColumn;
import javax.persistence.ManyToOne;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.Temporal;
import javax.persistence.TemporalType;
import javax.validation.constraints.Size;


@Entity
@Table(name = "AccessCode")
public class AccessCodeEntity{

  @Size(min = 4, max = 4)
  private String code;

  private String uuid;

  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  private Timestamp createdDate;

  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  private Timestamp startTime;

  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  private Timestamp endTime;

  private Status status;

  private QueueEntity queue;

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  /**
   * @return the code
   */
  public String getCode() {

    return this.code;
  }

  /**
   * @param code the code to set
   */
  public void setCode(String code) {

    this.code = code;
  }

  /**
   * @return the uuid
   */
  public String getUuid() {

    return this.uuid;
  }

  /**
   * @param uuid the uuid to set
   */
  public void setUuid(String uuid) {

    this.uuid = uuid;
  }

  /**
   * @return the created
   */
  public Timestamp getCreatedDate() {

    return this.createdDate;
  }

  /**
   * @param created the created to set
   */
  public void setCreatedDate(Timestamp createdDate) {

    this.createdDate = createdDate;
  }

  /**
   * @return the startTime
   */
  public Timestamp getStartTime() {

    return this.startTime;
  }

  /**
   * @param startTime the startTime to set
   */
  public void setStartTime(Timestamp startTime) {

    this.startTime = startTime;
  }

  /**
   * @return the endTime
   */
  public Timestamp getEndTime() {

    return this.endTime;
  }

  /**
   * @param endTime the endTime to set
   */
  public void setEndTime(Timestamp endTime) {

    this.endTime = endTime;
  }

  /**
   * @return the status
   */
  public Status getStatus() {

    return this.status;
  }

  /**
   * @param status the status to set
   */
  public void setStatus(Status status) {

    this.status = status;
  }

  /**
   * @return the queue
   */
  @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.DETACH, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
  @JoinColumn(name = "idQueue")
  public QueueEntity getQueue() {

    return this.queue;
  }

  /**
   * @param queue the queue to set
   */
  public void setQueue(QueueEntity queue) {

    this.queue = queue;
  }

}
----

[WARNING]
====
Eclipse will report some errors related to `QueueEntity` and `Status`. +
The errors related to QueueEntity will be resolved, when we create the corresponding class in the next step.
====

We will now resolve the erorrs related to `Status` by creating a new Enum `Status` in `jtqj-api/src/main/java/com.devonfw.application.jtqj.general.common.api`:
Copy and paste the following code in your class.

[source,java]
----
package com.devonfw.application.jtqj.general.common.api;


public enum Status {
  WAITING, ATTENDING, ATTENDED, SKIPPED, NOTSTARTED
}
----

We will import `Status` into `AccessCodeEntity` by inserting the following:

----
import com.devonfw.application.jtqj.general.common.api.Status;
----

The errors related to `Status` should now be gone.

==== _Queue_ Component
Finally, we are going to repeat the same process for our last entity _QueueEntity_ component. Create these packages in `/jtqj-core/src/main/java/`:
----
com.devonfw.application.jtqj.queuemanagement.dataaccess.api
----

\... and create a class called `QueueEntity` inside of them. +
We will end up with the following structure:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/queue_entity.png[Queue Entity, 250]

The contents of _QueueEntity_ before using CobiGen will be:

[source,java]
----
package com.devonfw.application.jtqj.queuemanagement.dataaccess.api;

package com.devonfw.application.jtqj.queuemanagement.dataaccess.api;

import java.sql.Timestamp;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.Temporal;
import javax.persistence.TemporalType;


@Entity
@Table(name = "Queue")
public class QueueEntity{

  private int minAttentionTime;

  private Boolean started;

  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  private Timestamp createdDate;


  /**
   * @return the minAttentionTime
   */
  public int getMinAttentionTime() {

    return this.minAttentionTime;
  }

  /**
   * @param minAttentionTime the minAttentionTime to set
   */
  public void setMinAttentionTime(int minAttentionTime) {

    this.minAttentionTime = minAttentionTime;
  }

  /**
   * @return the started
   */
  public Boolean getStarted() {

    return this.started;
  }

  /**
   * @param started the started to set
   */
  public void setStarted(Boolean started) {

    this.started = started;
  }

  /**
   * @return the createdDate
   */
  public Timestamp getCreatedDate() {

    return this.createdDate;
  }

  /**
   * @param createdDate the createdDate to set
   */
  public void setCreatedDate(Timestamp createdDate) {

    this.createdDate = createdDate;
  }

}

----

Now we have finished preparing the _core_ of our components and can start using CobiGen to generate the remaining structure (services, layers, DAOs, ...).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Now we can resolve the compilation errors related to `QueueEntity` in the `AccessCodeEntity.java` by applying the suggestions of the IDE. To do this, open the offending file, click the first red light bulb on the left border of the editor and select `Import 'QueueEntity' (com.devonfw. ...)`.

Or just manually add this line to your import statements:
----
import com.devonfw.application.jtqj.queuemanagement.dataaccess.api.QueueEntity;
----
====

=== The Component Structure (using CobiGen)
Once we are finished creating the _core_ of our components we could continue to create the structure and all elements manually, but we are going to use CobiGen for these tasks, since we can save a significant amount of time and effort this way.

First however, we need to make sure that the CobiGen plugin is installed in our Eclipse instance:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen_plugin_check.png[CobiGen Plugin Check, 550]

If you don't see this option in the dropdown menu, close Eclipse (remember to save all your progress) and in the `jump-the-queue` folder right-click to `Open a Devon CMD shell here`.

Now enter and execute:
----
devon eclipse add-plugin cobigen
----

\... and re-open Eclipse via the `eclipse-main.bat` script. 

==== CobiGen Health Check
When using CobiGen for the first time it's recommended to check the health of the tool. +
To do so, right-click one of our entities and select `CobiGen > Health Check...`.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen_health_1.png[CobiGen Health Check 1, 550]
image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen_error.PNG[CobiGen Error, 500]

If you happen to see the above error while running the Health Chek you will have to import the CobiGen Templates locally as follows:
Right-click in the Package-Manager and navigate to `CobiGen > Adapt Templates`.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/import_cobigen.png[Import CobiGen, 500]

A Warning will pop up: Click `OK`

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/import_cobigen_warning.PNG[Import CobiGen Warning, 500]

Once the import is done you need to click `OK` to finalize the import.

image::images//devon4j/4.Components/import_cobigen_info.PNG[Import CobiGen Info, 500]

The next dialogs will show us if there are outdated templates. In that case just click the "Update" button. You can also run an _Advanced Health Check_ to see exactly which CobiGen templates are available for this project.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen_health_2.png[CobiGen Health Check 2, 550]

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen_health_3.png[CobiGen Health Check 3, 400]

==== _Queue_ Component Structure (Entity without Relations)
In order to create the whole structure of a component with CobiGen we only need to right-click our component core entity (_QueueEntity_) and select `CobiGen > Generate`.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen1.png[CobiGen Generate, 550]

Now we'll get to choose which packages we want to generate with the tool.

To get the needed functionalities for our component we are going to select *all* of the following packages *at the same time*:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen3_allpackages.png[CobiGen Package Selection]

By default, all files will be selected for generation (which is what we want in this case), but you _could_ also change which files will be generated by clicking `Customize`.

For now just click `Finish` and let CobiGen do its work.

[NOTE]
====
In detail the selected options do the following:

* _CRUD SpringData Repository_: Generates the entity repository (that contains the CRUD operations) in the data access layer.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen2_crud_springdata_repository.png[CobiGen CRUD Spring Data Repository, 650]

* _CRUD REST Services_: Generates a complete service layer with CRUD operations for our entity exposed as a REST service.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen2_crud_rest_services.png[CobiGen CRUD REST Services, 650]

* _CRUD UC Logic_: Generates the logic layer dividing the implementation in different use cases.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen2_crud_uc_logic.png[CobiGen CRUD UC Logic, 650]

* _Entity Infrastructure_: Creates the entity main interface and edits (by a merge) the current entity to extend the devon classes.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen2_entity_infrastructure.png[CobiGen Entity Infrastructure, 650]

* _TO's_: Generates the related _Transfer Objects_, that we will explain in next chapters of this tutorial.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen2_to.png[CobiGen Transfer Objects, 650]
====

During the process CobiGen will show a message asking us to review some ambiguous references, which we will get to right away. For now just click `Continue`.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen4_review_imports.png[CobiGen Import Review]

Once CobiGen has finished generating the new classes, we will check for and fix those ambiguous references if we need to introduce manual adjustments.

First, we need to adjust manually some imports related to _Timestamp_ in:

*jtqj-core:*

* `queuemanagement.dataaccess.api.repo.QueueRepository`

*jtqj-api:*

* `queuemanagement.common.api.Queue`
* `queuemanagement.logic.api.to.QueueEto`
* `queuemanagement.logic.api.to.QueueSearchCriteriaTo`

We can fix these errors manually by adding `*import* java.sql.Timestamp` to the affected Java files:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen5_manual_import.png[CobiGen Manual Import]

==== _AccessCode_ Component Structure (Entity with Relations)
We repeat this process on our _AccessCodeEntity_, but in this case -- since its an entity with relations -- we are going to have to select different CobiGen options:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen-accesscode-new.png[CobiGen New AccessCode]

After CobiGen has finished generating, fix the issues regarding `*import* java.sql.Timestamp` (as you did in the last step) in the following files:

*jtqj-core:*

* `accesscodemanagement.dataaccess.api.repo.AccessCodeRepository`

*jtqj-api:*

* `accesscodemanagement.common.api.AccessCode`
* `accesscodemanagement.logic.api.to.AccessCodeEto`
* `accesscodemanagement.logic.api.to.AccessCodeSearchCriteriaTo`

There will be some compilation errors left. This is because we have some dependencies on _Queue_ and _Visitor_ component elements, that are not created yet. These compilation errors will be fixed in the next steps.

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen6_expected_errors.png[CobiGen Expeted Errors]

==== _Visitor_ Component Structure (Entity without Relations)
Finally we are going to generate the same classes that we generated for the _QueueEntity_ component for our _VisitorEntity_ component:

image::images/devon4j/4.Components/cobigen-visitor-new.png[CobiGen New Visitor]

Once CobiGen has finished we can fix the rest of the compilation errors related to `VisitorEto` by manually importing the class into:

*jtqj-core:*

* `accesscodemanagement.logic.impl.usecase.UcFindAccessCodeImpl`

*jtqj-api:*

* `accesscodemanagement.logic.api.to.AccessCodeCto`

==== Run the App
If all compilation errors are solved run the app (right-click `SpringBootApp.java > Run As > Java Application`). The backend should launch without errors.

*Congratulations!* +
You have created your first devon4j components. You should be able to access the login screen via http://localhost:8081/jumpthequeue[localhost:8081/jumpthequeue]. You can login with the username and password "*waiter*". In the next chapter we will show and explain each of the created elements in detail.
